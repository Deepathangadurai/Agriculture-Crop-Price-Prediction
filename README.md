# ðŸŒ¾ Agriculture Crop Price Prediction

An AI-based machine learning system that predicts **crop prices and production** using historical agricultural data, area, cost, and seasonal trends.  
Built with **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Streamlit** for an interactive web interface.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project aims to support farmers and policy-makers by providing intelligent insights into future crop prices and production.  
Using agricultural datasets, the system analyzes features like:
- Area cultivated
- Cost of cultivation
- Year and season
- Crop type and region

And predicts the **expected market price or production output**.
